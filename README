These scripts launch hunchentoot as a daemon at startup under FreeBSD
7.2 using detachtty (http://www.cliki.net/detachtty).  We could attach
to the lisp process to launch a swank server for slime to connect to.

First you need to create the user htoot which runs the hunchentoot web
server.  Its home directory is /var/lib/hunchentoot and it has no
login shell.  The files startup.lisp, core.lisp, htoot.conf and
htootd should be placed in the directory /var/lib/hunchentoot and the
file hunchentoot under /etc/rc.d.

Make sure that the directory /var/lib/hunchentoot is readable and
executable only by htoot and that this user owns all the files under
this directory.

* core.lisp: creates a custom core file for sbcl to speed up the
launch of the web server and the swank server.

* startup.lisp:  contains the procedures that launch hunchentoot and a
swank server.

* htoot.conf:  contains the general configurations of the hunchentoot
daemon on the system.

* htootd:  the hunchentoot daemon itself.  Make sure that this file is
executable only by htoot.  It could take 3 kind of arguments:
- start:  to start the hunchentoot web server.
- swank:  to start a swank server so we could connect to the server
with slime using: emacs --eval '(slime-connect "127.0.0.1" 4005)' at
the command line or 'M-x slime-connect RET RET' within emacs.  Use
slime-disconnect when you're done and the swank server would shut down
itself leaving hunchentoot running.
- stop: stop hunchentoot and do some cleanup

* hunchentoot: rc script for the hunchentoot daemon htootd.  It
runs hunchentoot as the user htoot and not as root.  You could add the
entry hunchentoot_enable="YES" in /etc/rc.conf to launch hunchentoot
automatically at startup.  To create a swank server you could execute
the command
> sudo /etc/rc.d/hunchentoot swank
or
> sudo /etc/rc.d/hunchentoot stop
to stop it.
