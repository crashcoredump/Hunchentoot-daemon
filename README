These scripts launch hunchentoot as a daemon at startup under FreeBSD
7.2 using detachtty (http://www.cliki.net/detachtty).  We could attach
to the lisp process to launch a swank server for slime to connect to.

First you need to create the user htoot which runs the hunchentoot web
server.  Its home directory is /var/lib/hunchentoot and it has no
login shell.  The files startup.lisp, core.lisp, htoot.conf and
htootd should be placed in the directory /var/lib/hunchentoot and the
file hunchentoot under /etc/rc.d.

Make sure that the directory /var/lib/hunchentoot is readable and
executable only by htoot and that this user owns all the files under
this directory.

* patch-src-attachtty.c:

	This patched version of attachtty allows to pass code to a
	detached lisp process and set timeouts
	(http://common-lisp.net/project/bese/repos/detachtty).  If you
	install detachtty using the ports collection, you just need to
	place this file in the directory /usr/ports/misc/detachtty/files.

* core.lisp:

	Creates a custom core file for sbcl to speed up the launch of
	the web server and the swank server.

* startup.lisp:

	Contains the procedures that launch hunchentoot and a swank server.

* htoot.conf:

        Contains the general configurations of the hunchentoot daemon
        on the system.

* htootd:

        The hunchentoot daemon itself.  Make sure that this file is
        executable only by htoot.  It could take 5 kind of arguments:
        - start: to start the hunchentoot web server.
        - swank: to start a swank server so we could connect to the
        server with slime using: emacs --eval '(slime-connect
        "127.0.0.1" 4005)' at the command line or 'M-x slime-connect
        RET RET' within emacs.  Use slime-disconnect when you're done
        and the swank server would shut down itself leaving
        hunchentoot running.
        - attach: to attach to the detached lisp process running
        hunchentoot.
        - log: to see the latest entries in the log
        file.
        - stop: stop hunchentoot and do some cleanup.

* hunchentoot:

        rc script for the hunchentoot daemon htootd.  It runs
        hunchentoot as the user htoot and not as root.  You could add
        the entry hunchentoot_enable="YES" in /etc/rc.conf to launch
        hunchentoot automatically at startup.  To create a swank
        server you could execute the command:
        > sudo /etc/rc.d/hunchentoot swank
        or
        > sudo /etc/rc.d/hunchentoot stop
        to stop it.
